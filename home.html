	<h3>How to use</h3>
	<p>
		To use this, put the HTML code the app give you to the &lt; head &gt;.<br>
		<span style="color:red;">Please do not rely on this app because I can clean the file anytime without warning. (But I'll not clean really often)</span><br>
		<a href="/h">Create a view tracking code</a>
	</p>
	<h3>Command Line Interface</h3>
	<p>
		To use with CLI, use http post method with the folowing post data to https://Web-views-tracking.lukenk.repl.co/cli:<br><br>
		<code>"respond" : [your_option]</code>
		<br><br>
		There are 2 option: <br>

	</p>
	<!-- <h3>Run option</h3>
	<p>
		To use this, paste the HTML content in the text box, this app will make will return the link with the HTML value. You can later use that link to run your HTML content.<br>
		This option is more reliable but the size of your HTML content is limited because your HTML content is <span style="color:red;">in the link</span> itself.
